# API Aparat

This is a **training project** built to practice API development in PHP (or Laravel-based structure), focusing on clean code, maintainability, and applying design patterns. Despite its name, this project has **no affiliation with Aparat** and is not related to the official Aparat API.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project simulates a real-world API-based backend, demonstrating RESTful architecture and software engineering best practices. It is intended for learning and experimenting with:

- Route structuring
- Controller-Service-Repository layers
- Clean and modular coding practices
- Design pattern application

This project is ideal for developers who want to enhance their backend skills and learn how to structure medium-scale APIs in a clean and extendable way.
